---------
THE MAZE RUNNER — Mini Project 1: Classical Search

This is where you implement the search algorithms (Questions 1–7).

Every algorithm receives a SearchProblem (see problems.py) and must return a
LIST OF ACTIONS that leads from the start state to a goal state, e.g.
['South', 'South', 'East']. Return [] if the start state is already a goal.

Conventions the grader relies on (please read — they matter!):

  * Use the fringe containers from util.py (Stack, Queue, PriorityQueue).
  * Calling problem.getSuccessors(state) counts as EXPANDING that state.
    Call it exactly once per expanded state, and never for a state you only
    generated.
  * Goal test when a state is POPPED from the fringe (just before you would
    expand it), not when it is pushed. (For BFS the grader also accepts
    the "early" goal test done when a state is generated.)
  * Push successors in the order getSuccessors returns them.
  * Q1, Q2, Q5, Q6, Q7 are GRAPH searches: keep a set of already-expanded
    states and never expand the same state twice.
