---------------
Questions 8 and 9: escaping through the Griever Hole.

The Griever Hole only opens after the runners have entered the escape code.
The pieces of the code (marked K in the maze) are scattered through the
corridors. Thomas has to pick up ALL of them, in any order, and then reach the
exit E. Picking up a piece happens automatically when he steps onto its cell.

Try it once you are done:
    python runner.py -l keys_small -p keys -a bfs
    python runner.py -l keys_medium -p keys -a astar -H keyhunt

    Q8: Collect every code piece, then reach the exit.

    You choose the state representation, with two requirements:
      1. A state must be HASHABLE (tuples, frozensets, ints, strings... but
         not lists, sets or dicts), because your search keeps them in sets.
      2. A state must be a TUPLE whose FIRST element is Thomas's (row, col)
         position. The display and the grader read state[0].

    Keep the state small: store only what you need to know to decide what
    happens next. Do NOT put the whole maze in the state.

    Q9: A heuristic for KeyHuntProblem.

    It must be CONSISTENT (and therefore admissible): for every state s and
    successor s' reached with step cost c,  h(s) <= c + h(s'),  and h must be
    0 at goal states. The grader checks this.

    The more informed (larger) your heuristic is while staying consistent,
    the fewer states A* expands and the more points you earn.

    Useful tools:
      * problem.keys, problem.exit, and whatever your state stores
      * mazeDistance(pos1, pos2, problem.maze, problem.heuristicInfo) gives
        the true number of steps between two cells, and caches the result
